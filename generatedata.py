 1. Here, it is to generate specific distribution data that meets the simulation
    requirements of our experiment.
 2. There are three important parameters: variance, sample length(n_runs) and hr(hazard rste).
 3. you can adjust them at will to meet your analysis requirements .
    (other distributed data can also be used for this model simulation)
                                                                      from XY_fu
